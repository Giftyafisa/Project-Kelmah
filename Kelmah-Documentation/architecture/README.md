# Kelmah Platform Architecture

This document provides an overview of the Kelmah Platform's architecture, design patterns, and technology choices.

## System Architecture

Kelmah follows a modern microservices architecture with domain-driven design principles. The system is divided into two main components:

1. **Frontend**: A React-based single-page application (SPA)
2. **Backend**: A collection of microservices built around domain boundaries

## Design Patterns

### Frontend

- **Modular Architecture**: The frontend is organized into domain-specific modules
- **Component-Based Design**: Reusable UI components following atomic design principles
- **Hooks Pattern**: Custom hooks for shared logic
- **Context API**: For state management across component trees
- **Container/Presentation Pattern**: Separating logic from presentation

### Backend

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services organized around business domains
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services with specific responsibilities
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Central entry point for all client requests
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic encapsulation
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation for more complex domains

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: UI library
- **Vite**: Build tool
- **React Router**: Client-side routing
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management (for complex state)
- **React Context**: State management (for simpler state)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Axios**: HTTP client
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: Testing

### Backend

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web framework
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for document storage
- **Sequelize**: ORM for SQL databases
- **JWT**: Authentication
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication
- **Winston**: Logging
- **Jest**: Testing

## Communication Patterns

1. **Synchronous Communication**: REST APIs for client-to-service and some service-to-service communication
2. **Asynchronous Communication**: WebSockets for real-time features and event-based communication between services

## Security Model

- **JWT-Based Authentication**: For securing API endpoints
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for workers, hirers, and admins
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **CORS Policies**: Configured for security
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can be independently scaled
- **Stateless Design**: Facilitates load balancing
- **Caching Strategy**: Implemented for frequently accessed data
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized for query patterns
