# Kelmah Backend Restructuring - Next Steps

## Progress So Far

1. Created the basic directory structure for the domain-driven design:
   - Set up auth-service structure
   - Set up user-service structure
   - Set up job-service structure
   - Set up payment-service structure
   - Set up messaging-service structure
   - Set up API Gateway structure

2. Moved some key files to their new locations:
   - Moved auth controller to auth-service
   - Moved job controller to job-service
   - Moved User model to user-service
   - Moved Job model to job-service
   - Moved utility files to respective services

## Next Steps

1. Complete the migration of models:
   - Move RefreshToken model to auth-service
   - Move Application model to job-service
   - Move Contract model to job-service
   - Move Message model to messaging-service
   - Move Payment model to payment-service
   - Move Review model to review-service

2. Update import paths in all files:
   - Update model imports to reference the new locations
   - Update utility imports to reference the new locations
   - Update middleware imports to reference the new locations

3. Create server.js files for each service:
   - Complete auth-service/server.js
   - Create user-service/server.js
   - Create job-service/server.js
   - Create payment-service/server.js
   - Create messaging-service/server.js
   - Create notification-service/server.js

4. Set up the API Gateway:
   - Create proxy middleware for each service
   - Set up routes to forward to appropriate services
   - Implement authentication and authorization middleware

5. Update the main index.js to orchestrate all services:
   - Update service paths
   - Add new services to the orchestration
   - Implement proper startup sequence

6. Create Docker configuration:
   - Create Dockerfile for each service
   - Create docker-compose.yml for local development
   - Set up environment variables for service discovery

7. Update documentation:
   - Update API documentation to reflect the new structure
   - Create service-specific documentation
   - Update deployment instructions

## Testing Plan

1. Test each service individually:
   - Verify that each service starts correctly
   - Verify that each service's API endpoints work correctly
   - Verify that each service's database connections work correctly

2. Test the API Gateway:
   - Verify that requests are properly routed to services
   - Verify that authentication and authorization work correctly
   - Verify that error handling works correctly

3. Test the entire system:
   - Verify that all services work together correctly
   - Verify that the orchestration script works correctly
   - Verify that the system can handle failures gracefully

## Deployment Plan

1. Set up CI/CD pipeline for each service
2. Set up monitoring and logging
3. Set up service discovery in production
4. Set up load balancing
5. Set up database replication and backups
